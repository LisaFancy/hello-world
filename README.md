# hello-world
Hi GitHub,

I'm new here, and start learning data analysis after graduation. It's a challenge for me because my background is far from computer science and I only got 60 scores in my only computer lesson called VB, but I'd like to try the second time, to approach computer science.

Now, I am learning Python.
